# Brain-Model-Test
A very simplified, layered model of a human brain using Python, Tensorflow 2, and Keras.

## What is this?
This, as the description says, is an attempt to model brain function pathways in Python. It is much slower than direct data processing, however, and is not recommended to be used until a tagged release.
